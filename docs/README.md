# FuncDraw Docs

Welcome! These docs live under `docs/` so GitHub Pages can host them directly. Pick a topic to dive in:

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) – tour the hosted FuncDraw Player and learn how to iterate on an example.
- [Programming Model](programming-model.md) – understand how expressions, collections, and module folders turn into a renderable graph.
- [Primitives Reference](primitives-reference.md) – catalog of shape objects the runtime understands.

Looking for the hosted experience? Open https://funcdraw.app to launch the FuncDraw Player.
