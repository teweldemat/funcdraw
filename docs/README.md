# FuncDraw Docs

Welcome! These docs live under `docs/` so GitHub Pages can host them directly. Pick a topic to dive in:

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) – open the hosted FuncDraw Player, clone the workspace, and iterate on an example.
- [Programming Model](programming-model.md) – understand how expressions, collections, and module folders turn into a renderable graph.
- [Primitives Reference](primitives-reference.md) – catalog of shape objects the runtime understands.

Looking for the hosted experience? Open the FuncDraw Player on the FuncScript documentation site: https://teweldemat.github.io/funcscript/player/
